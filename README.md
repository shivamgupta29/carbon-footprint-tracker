## 🌍 Why Focus on India?

India has a very different set of conditions:

- Auto-rickshaws, trains, metros — all used daily
- Power sources vary by state
- LPG is common for cooking
- Food patterns differ by region
- Emissions should ideally be tracked in **₹ (Rupees)** too

This app tries to reflect that reality.
